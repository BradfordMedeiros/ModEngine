# ModEngine

ModEngine is a game engine which is built to allow creation of quake-style first person shooters with minimal to no programming experience, and to encourage game modification. 

ModEngine values ease of use, thinks most things can be achieved with a game-like editor, and minimal scripting should be required to get custom behavior. 
Mod Engine thinks that a simple representation of what data exists in game is important as it allows external tooling and editing to become easy.
