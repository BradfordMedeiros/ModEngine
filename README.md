# ModEngine

ModEngine is a game engine which is built to allow creation of quake-style first person shooters with minimal to no programming experience, and to encourage game modification. 

ModEngine values ease of use, thinks most things can be achieved with a game-like editor, and scripting should only be required for advanced game modification. 
Mod Engine thinks that a simple representation of what data exists in game is important as it allows external tooling and editing to become easy. 

ModEngine believes that the complexity of modern engines is fine for gaming in general, but not ideal for hardcore pc mod fps scene, that this engine hopes to help resurrect.  The reason for that is simple: the hardcore pc mod scene hugely benefits from user content and mods.  The community can make a better game than I can.   

ModEngine hopes to encourage a renaissance of hardcore FPS, and make creation of FPS something more approachable for gamers, not just developers.  We're targeting the pc literate gamers, who can probably figure out how to code anyway, but that might not be their thing, or they might not have enough experience yet.  This will also serve as a great segway for gamers to learn how to code -- but again, this is about hardcore FPS.
