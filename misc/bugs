general:
- name scoping fucked up
- timing in general

horrible but "correct"
- full scene traverse to get position (fix with simple object representation, hierachy is just opt constraint graph)

object specific:
heightmaps:
- need to recalculate vertex normals for when update heightmap 
- heightmaps have arbitrary limits for height 

portals:
- portals dont handle occulusion culling
