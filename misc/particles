General approach:
A particle system in my view is about:

- spawning objects
- unspawning objects
   - based on time
   - based on max count
   - how fast?
- should work with "any" object type (why only 2D quads?)
- resource efficient (reuse objects vs destroying them)
- be able to call events on there lifecycle (eg if it hits the ground, spawn another particle?)
    - eg rain causes a rainsplatter effect on the ground
- be able to vary some attribute values (scale? position?) 
    - linearly
    - random
    - according to a distribution?

- spawn objects w/ custom attribute overrides!
