General approach:
A particle system in my view is about:

- spawning objects
- unspawning objects
   - [X] based on time
   - [X] based on max count
   - [X] how fast?
- [X] should work with "any" object type (why only 2D quads?)
- [O] resource efficient (reuse objects vs destroying them)
- [O] be able to call events on there lifecycle (eg if it hits the ground, spawn another particle?)
    - eg rain causes a rainsplatter effect on the ground
- be able to vary some attribute values (scale? position?) 
    - [O] linearly
    - [O] random
    - [O] according to a distribution?

- [X] spawn objects w/ custom attribute overrides!
