next:
  - more voxel work
    - get block select working again
    - single texture per block?
    - create brush to expand up down
    - create brush to expand left right
    - create option to connect the blocks?

musts:

- fix animation and make sure it's good 
  - set poses in game
  - ragdoll?

- voxel for world creation
  - different brushes to help with world creation

- ai 
  - navmeshes
  - navmeshes have transitions to allow special actions to make the transition


nice to have/less immediate:
  - shadow mapping
  - lightmaps 
  - movie playback textures
  - better font rendering

separate scenegraph from object rendering
fix voxel rendering
voxels can use any texture
fix animation system
allow model posing
network attributes
heightmap brushes
recorder working
improve networking code
sounds use positional data
fix memory reference incorrectness for scheme
emitter system upgrades (more movement types)
automatic world chunking
ai system goals 
windows build
openvr integration
c++ plugin system 
shadowmapping
lightmapping
movie playback

ease of use - multi-select, copy pasta, mirror
