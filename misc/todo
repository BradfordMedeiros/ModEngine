4 - 1 hour sessions in this next week for 3d modeling
-> spend on the art and make models or levels

next todo:

* separate scenegraph from object rendering

* fix animation system
  - allow model posing
  - inverse kinematics

* recorder -> generalize all attributes
* ai system goals 
* cleanup physics code
* scoping of scenes (all objects are in shared namespace)

======================

need tos, but kind of put offish:
* serialization of attributes incomplete/ broken
* better movie playback - add audio  (swr_convert?)
* fix memory reference incorrectness for scheme
* generalize shadow code (plumb in correct shadow map)
- performance profiling
- better framepacing
- fix networking code
- for attributes, pass around runtime symbols/atoms/whatever instead of strings
* heightmap: - heighmaps don't recalculate normals (can just reload the scene or the gameobj)
* automatic world chunking ==> take every loaded scene, and then divide these up into chunks
* portals need to handle occlusion of an object better (if something is behind the portal camera it can be seen)

eventually:
- c++ plugin system 
- lightmapping
- triplanar mapping
- normal mapping
- pbr 
- destructable voxels
- cool physics toys
- windows build
- improve build code
- openvr integration
- ragdoll
- better fonts
- better voxel editing
- long running "dormant" scripts (eg for a quest system, or to just set some attributes)
- central store system for data (sql style system?)
- decal system

mocap? 
- passive ball based

problems you want solved first:
- be able to take multiple video streams
- do some basic image processing on these to identify the balls
===> calibrate against background image, and then the diff should identify the balls
===> position in fn (camera position, identified color in video feed)
===> multiple cameras, identify position (might be occuluded, maybe average? might be able to weight based upon visibility %?)

core problems:
- identify balls in the scene
- differentiate balls in scene
- locate position of balls in scene

software things to solve
- create a way to map the balls to bone hierarchy

- how to integrate into blender?
